Sonic Colors Voice Mod Ultimate
------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Sonic Colors Voice Mod Ultimate, This mod goes for 100% accuracy when porting over the voices from Sonic Colors released in 2010 for the Wii and Sonic Colors Ultimate Released in 2021 for Xbox, Playsation, Switch and PC.

The voices included are the main player voice for sonic, jumpboard voices when going over a trickjumpboard or ramp at top speed or no speed at all, Upreel (Pulley Voices), and best of all the trick voice announcer in the proper order.

Due to code injection this mod is only 1mb or less since only the voice archive for sonic needs to be modified instead of the voice archive along with the game object archive.

Voice Modes
-------------------------------

This mod features "Voice Modes" Which can be picked between via the Hedge Mod Manager Configuration Menu by right clicking on the mod. With these you can pick between Sonic Colors and Sonic Colors Ultimate.


Original: This will present the voices as they were in the Original Wii release in 2010. Some voices were muted Via code by Sonic Team instead of in the sound archive. This is 100% accurate to Sonic Team their vision.

Sonic Colors Ultimate: This will present the voices as they are in Sonic Colors Ultimate. When porting the game to modern platforms Blind Squirel accidently reimplimented the un-used voice clips by outright forgetting to mute them in the voice archive or via code like Sonic Team intended. This results in grunts that sound out of place compared to the ones used in the original in some spots.
